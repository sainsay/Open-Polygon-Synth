# Open-Polygon-Synth
Open-source polyphonic polygon synthesizer or OPS
This is very much still a work in progress.

# Roadmap
v0.1.x - implement basic polygon shape manipulations  
v0.2.x - envelops and basic lfo modulation  
v0.3.x - visuals revamped  
v0.4.x - filters  
v0.5.x - modulation routing and S&H sources  
...  

Synth design inspired by:
- "Continuous Order Polygonal Waveform Synthesis" - C.Hohnerlein et al. (2016)
- "The Geometric Oscillator: Sound Synthesis with Cyclic Shapes." - A. Berndt et al. (2017)
- "Efficient Anti-aliasing of a Complex Polygonal Oscillator" - C.Hohnerlein et al. (2017)
